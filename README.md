In it, you need to collect PomPoms, but be careful, not all what looks like a PomPom is a REAL PomPom. Collect as many REAL ones as you can :)

More on the game mechanics
-----
You are to change back and forth between Real and Not Real views.
In Real view you can see which PomPom is actually going to give you points, but being in this view will cost you too much "fuel" so you need to switch back to Not Real view and remember where were the PomPoms you need to catch. Your should also avoid the other PomPoms because catching the wrong ones will decrease your "fuel".
